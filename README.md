----------------------------------------------------CS 370 Final Project: Pirate Agent Deep Q Learning-----------------------------------------------------

The work I did on this project from the CS 370 course, Current/Emerging Trends in CS where we learned about Machine Learning. The work that was given to me were the two python classes of GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py
and the main class that imports the aforementioned files. The code block I worked on was the q_train function block that randomly gives the pirate agent a direction, and lets the agent decide whether to explore a path or exploit a path using an operator to compare the random number to elipson. The exploit decision uses the q_value generated through a reward from the reinforcement model.

As a computer scientist, my goal is to design, develop, analyze, and troubleshoot software and/or hardware. Within the last century, computer technologies have found a foothold in vital branches of operation in society. Computers are essential tools for workers to perform important tasks, like printing and collecting data, using the internet to send information, automating machines that help with manual labour, to name a few examples. Developing and maintaining these is a computer scientist's responsibility. In recent years an emerging trend in computer science has become more mainstream and widely used: Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence agents are trained with sources of data designated to create output based on how the program functions. Commonly seen output of machine learning are algorithms that use user data to keep users engaging with the software. Models and agents can overstep the boundaries of what is personal data and what is public data without communication with the user. To address the ethical concern as computer scientists, we need to give the user more control of what they can or can't provide to the agent, to balance the performance of the app's feature, and the user trust that companies should hold dearly.
